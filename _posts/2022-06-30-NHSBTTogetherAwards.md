AB nominated me for an NHSBT Together Awards.

As part of the nomination, AB wrote a justification.  Having talked previously to AB about the fact that CS often tells me that “I am not persuasive, I’m just persistent”, AB included the phrasing that I am delivering a project “through his persistence and understanding”.  I confirmed with AB that they did put that phrasing in as a bit of tongue-in-cheek comment!
